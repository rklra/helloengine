PvE Weapons Rolls
All perks listed are recommened. “If bad” means that its worse than alternative recommended perks, but the perk is still a good choice. “If worse” is a bit worse that “if bad.” “High tier” and “strong” is a very good choice and “god tier” is literally the best across all weapons in the weapon type.

truthteller / empty vessel


best to worst imo for DPS for izzi swapping(assuming ALH, cuz ALH is must have)
vessel (must be ALH + Vorpal, spike is bonus)
truthteller (must be ALH + spike, QD is bonus)
otherwise, ALH vessel = ALH truthteller

Glaives
Glaive's role in PvE: Survivability via blocking and close range ad clear (like using a shotgun for clearing ads, but infinite ammo). Not DPS: Less CQC dps than a slug shotgun, less ranged dps than a grenade launcher.

both glaives work roughly the same
farm: lubrae (craft, vow enc 4), enigma (craft)
